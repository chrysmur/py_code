Consider a web-based calendar in which the server hosting the calendar has to perform a task when
the next calendar event takes place. (The task could be sending an email or a Short Message Service
(SMS).) 
Your job is to design a facility that manages the execution of such tasks.
Develop a timer class that manages the execution of deferred tasks. The timer constructor takes as
its argument an object which includes a run method and a string-valued name field. 
The class must supportâ€”
(1.) starting a thread, identified by name, at a given time in the future; and 
(2.) canceling a thread, identified by name (the cancel request is to be ignored if the thread has already started).

## How
 Greedy algo is usually the solution for optimization problem, where there is a natural set of choices to select from
 Best  to conceptualize a greedy algotiyhm recursively and then implement it using iteration for higher perfomance
 
 ### Invariants
 - invariant is a condition that is true during execution of a program.
 This condition may be on the values of the variables of the program or on the cotnrol logic
 e.g binary search maintains the invariant that the space of candidate solution contains all possible solutions as the algorithm executes
